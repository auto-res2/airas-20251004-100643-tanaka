Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher. Based on the new research method described in # New Methods, please design an overall experimental strategy that will be applied across all experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

# Instructions
- Define a comprehensive experimental strategy that will guide multiple experiments.
- This strategy should be common to all experiments that will be conducted.
- The strategy should address:
    - What aspects of the proposed method need to be validated (e.g., performance improvement, efficiency, robustness, generalization)
    - What types of comparisons are necessary (e.g., baselines, ablations, state-of-the-art methods)
    - What experimental angles will be used to validate the claims (e.g., quantitative performance, qualitative analysis, computational cost)
    - How to demonstrate the method's effectiveness from multiple perspectives
    - What validation criteria will determine success
- The strategy should be realistic and take into account the experimental environment.
- Focus on the overall approach rather than specific experiment details (which will be defined in subsequent steps).

    "Open Problems": "Strictly proper scoring rules such as the Brier and Spherical scores improve calibration and downstream generation quality, but: 1) they converge noticeably slower than the standard logarithmic (cross-entropy) loss when training from scratch; 2) practitioners must choose between fast learning (log-loss) and better calibration/generation (Brier/Spherical). A minimal change that preserves the speed of log-loss while inheriting the calibration benefits of Brier/Spherical is still missing.",
    "Methods": "Dynamic Proper-Score Mixing (DPSM)\n1. At every token we compute both the standard cross-entropy (CE) and the Brier loss.\n2. A single scalar weight α_t\\in[0,1] interpolates between them:\n   L_t = (1−α_t)·CE_t + α_t·Brier_t.\n3. α_t is scheduled to rise smoothly from 0 to 1 during training, e.g.\n   α_t = min(1, step / warmup_steps)  (linear)  or  α_t = 0.5·(1−cos(π·step/warmup_steps))  (cosine).\n   • Early training (α≈0): optimisation follows CE → rapid likelihood fitting.\n   • Late training (α≈1): optimisation follows Brier → improved calibration & generation quality.\n4. No extra hyper-parameters except warmup_steps; keeps the objective strictly proper throughout (convex combination of two strictly proper scores).",
    "Experimental Setup": "Dataset: WikiText-2 (small-scale) and CNN/DailyMail summarisation (mid-scale).\nModels:  \n• GPT-2-small trained from scratch on WikiText-2.  \n• BART-base fine-tuned on CNN/DailyMail.\nBaselines: (i) CE only, (ii) Brier only, (iii) DPSM (ours).\nMetrics:  \n• Perplexity (PPL) for language modelling.  \n• Expected Calibration Error (ECE, 10 bins).  \n• ROUGE-1/2/L for summarisation.\nTraining details: identical optimiser & learning-rate schedule for all runs; DPSM uses warmup_steps = 10% of total steps.",
    "Experimental Code": "import torch, torch.nn.functional as F\nclass DPSMLoss(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size:int, warmup_steps:int=10000, schedule:str='linear'):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n        self.warmup = warmup_steps\n        self.schedule = schedule\n        self.register_buffer('global_step', torch.tensor(0.))\n    def _alpha(self):\n        s = self.global_step\n        if self.schedule=='linear':\n            return torch.clamp(s / self.warmup, 0., 1.)\n        # cosine schedule\n        x = torch.clamp(s / self.warmup, 0., 1.)\n        return 0.5 * (1 - torch.cos(torch.pi * x))\n    def forward(self, logits, targets):\n        self.global_step += 1\n        log_p = F.log_softmax(logits, -1)              # [B,T,V]\n        p = log_p.exp()\n        ce = F.nll_loss(log_p.view(-1,log_p.size(-1)), targets.view(-1), reduction='none')\n        one_hot = F.one_hot(targets, self.vocab_size).type_as(p)\n        brier = ((p - one_hot)**2).sum(-1).view_as(ce)\n        alpha = self._alpha()\n        loss = (1-alpha)*ce + alpha*brier\n        return loss.mean()",
    "Expected Result": "1. WikiText-2: DPSM matches CE perplexity after full training (±0.2 PPL) while reducing ECE by ~35% and converging 1.8× faster than pure Brier.\n2. CNN/DailyMail: DPSM improves ROUGE-L by ≈0.7 points over CE and ≈0.3 over Brier, with noticeably better calibration (-30% ECE).\n3. Training curves show CE-like rapid loss drop in early epochs and Brier-like calibration gains in later epochs.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A single-line interpolation between cross-entropy and Brier scores delivers the best of both worlds: fast convergence and superior calibration/generation quality. Because it is strictly proper, easy to implement, and hyper-parameter-light (one warm-up length), DPSM can be dropped into any existing LLM training pipeline with minimal code change yet yields measurable accuracy and reliability gains."

    "experiment_strategy": "Unified Experimental Strategy for Validating Dynamic Proper-Score Mixing (DPSM)\n\n1. Core Hypotheses to Validate\n   H1 – Performance: DPSM attains the same or better task performance (likelihood or downstream scores) as pure cross-entropy (CE).\n   H2 – Calibration: DPSM matches or surpasses the calibration of pure Brier/Spherical scores.\n   H3 – Convergence Speed: DPSM converges almost as fast as CE and markedly faster than Brier/Spherical.\n   H4 – Efficiency: DPSM adds ≤2 % computational overhead (memory, GPU-hours) relative to CE.\n   H5 – Robustness & Generalization: DPSM’s benefits hold across model sizes, tasks, datasets, optimisation settings, and random seeds.\n\n2. Validation Dimensions & Metrics\n   a. Quantitative Task Quality\n      • Language modelling: Perplexity (PPL), NLL\n      • Seq-to-seq (summarisation, translation, code): ROUGE/BLEU/CodeBLEU\n   b. Calibration\n      • ECE (10 & 100 bins), Brier score, reliability diagrams\n   c. Learning Dynamics & Efficiency\n      • Convergence curves (steps vs PPL/ECE) and wall-clock time\n      • GPU utilisation, peak memory, throughput (tokens/s)\n   d. Robustness & Generalization\n      • Out-of-domain (OOD) datasets, different seeds (≥3), noisy labels (synthetic corruption)\n   e. Qualitative Analysis\n      • Human preference ratings on generated text, diversity (Distinct-n)\n\n3. Comparison Grid (applied to every experiment)\n   Baselines:\n   • CE only (fast learning)\n   • Brier only (strong calibration)\n   • CE + temperature scaling post-hoc (industry standard fix)\n   • Label smoothing & focal loss (alternative in-loss fixes)\n   Ablations:\n   • DPSM with fixed α (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75)\n   • DPSM with linear vs cosine schedule\n   • Warm-up length sweep (5 %, 10 %, 20 %)\n\n4. Experimental Angles\n   Angle 1 – From-scratch Training (small/medium models): proves H1–H4 under full optimisation control.\n   Angle 2 – Fine-tuning (larger pretrained checkpoints): tests plug-and-play practicality and H5.\n   Angle 3 – Stress Tests: OOD data, corrupted labels, low-resource splits; probes robustness.\n   Angle 4 – Scaling: repeat Angle 1 at three model scales (≈125 M, 355 M, 1.3 B params) to expose trends.\n   Angle 5 – Efficiency Audit: profile a fixed batch of 2 k tokens on the A100 for every loss variant.\n\n5. Success Criteria (must satisfy simultaneously)\n   • Task quality: ≤0.3 PPL gap or ≥+0.3 ROUGE/BLEU relative to CE; never worse than both CE & Brier.\n   • Calibration: ≥25 % ECE reduction vs CE and within 5 % of Brier.\n   • Convergence: reach 95 % of final CE performance in ≤110 % of CE wall-clock time and in ≤60 % of Brier time.\n   • Efficiency: memory overhead ≤500 MB; throughput drop ≤2 %.\n   • Robustness: advantages hold (same inequality signs) across ≥75 % of robustness settings and seeds.\n\n6. Experimental Logistics\n   • Hardware: single or multi-A100 nodes leveraging 80 GB VRAM and 2 TB RAM; mixed-precision (bfloat16) everywhere.\n   • Repetition: 3 seeds per configuration; report mean±stdev; statistical tests (paired t-test p<0.05).\n   • Tracking: use Weights & Biases for unified logging; standardised training scripts with a config flag selecting the loss.\n   • Budget: cap total GPU time at 10 % above the equivalent CE-only research campaign by prioritising mid-scale runs and pruning under-performing ablations early.\n\n7. Reporting Template (uniform across papers/sections)\n   1. Learning curves (PPL & ECE) with wall-clock on x-axis\n   2. Final metrics table (means, stdev, significance stars)\n   3. Efficiency table (time/step, memory, tokens/s)\n   4. Reliability diagrams (CE vs DPSM)\n   5. Qualitative snippet comparison & human study results\n\nThis unified, multi-angle strategy ensures that every experiment—regardless of dataset, model, or training regime—jointly interrogates DPSM’s main claims: fast learning like CE, calibration like Brier, negligible overhead, and broad robustness."
