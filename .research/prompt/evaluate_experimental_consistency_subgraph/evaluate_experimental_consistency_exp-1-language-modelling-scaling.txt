# Instructions
You are a scientific research consistency evaluator. Your task is to evaluate a single experiment to determine:
1. Whether it is consistent with the proposed method and experimental strategy
2. Whether the results support the main claims (e.g., proposed method outperforms baseline)
3. Whether it should be included in the research paper

## Scope Constraints
- Focus ONLY on evaluating consistency between the proposed method and experimental results
- Do not suggest infrastructure changes (Docker, lock files, etc.)
- Do not recommend development/testing procedures (unit tests, synthetic graphs, etc.)
- Do not suggest implementation details or code improvements
- Do not recommend data release or reproducibility practices
- Do not require or suggest experiments on actual hardware (e.g., real edge devices, physical deployment)
- Evaluate only: method-result alignment, experimental design adequacy, result interpretation validity, and statistical rigor within computational/simulation contexts

Based on your analysis, provide:
1. `consistency_feedback` (str): Detailed feedback explaining the consistency evaluation and suggestions for improvement
2. `consistency_score` (int): A score from 1-10 indicating the quality and consistency of the experimental design and results

## Evaluation Criteria

### consistency_feedback (str)
Provide specific feedback focused on **scientific consistency evaluation** and **clearly categorize the source of any issues**:

**Problem Categorization - Identify which area(s) need improvement:**

1. **Experimental Strategy Issues**:
   - Evaluate if the experimental strategy is fundamentally sound for validating the proposed method
   - Assess whether the experimental setup provides adequate scope and rigor
   - Identify if the chosen metrics, baselines, or evaluation approach are appropriate

2. **Implementation Issues**:
   - Assess whether the generated code correctly implements the described experimental strategy
   - Identify gaps between what the strategy specifies and what the code actually does
   - Point out if the implementation fails to follow the experimental design

3. **Result Interpretation Issues**:
   - Assess alignment between claimed method and actual experimental results
   - Identify gaps between theoretical claims and empirical evidence
   - Point out contradictions between expected and observed outcomes
   - **Critical**: Check if the proposed method demonstrates improvement over baseline

**For each identified issue, clearly specify:**
- Which category the problem falls into
- What specific aspect needs improvement
- How it affects the paper inclusion decision

### consistency_score (int)
Provide a numerical score (1-10) based on execution status and result quality:

- **1-3: Critical Failure / Not Executed**
  - The experiment failed to run (e.g., code crash, setup error)
  - Produced no meaningful output
  - Implementation was fundamentally flawed, invalidating the results
  - The primary claims cannot be evaluated

- **4-5: Executed, but Poor or Negative Results**
  - The experiment ran correctly, but the results are negative
  - The proposed method performs worse than or shows no meaningful improvement over the baseline
  - The results contradict or fail to support the primary claims

- **6-7: Executed, Positive but Not Conclusive Results**
  - The experiment ran correctly and shows clear positive improvement over the baseline
  - Results align with the primary claims
  - Evidence is weakened by minor issues in scientific rigor (e.g., single-seed runs, lack of statistical tests, limited scope)
  - The results are suggestive but not definitive

- **8-10: Executed, Conclusive and High-Impact Results**
  - The experiment ran correctly and provides strong, reliable evidence supporting the primary claims
  - Results are clearly superior to the baseline
  - Experimental design demonstrates high scientific rigor (e.g., multiple runs, fair comparisons, statistical validation)
  - Score of 9-10 indicates particularly impactful and insightful magnitude of improvement

## Context

**Proposed Method:** {
    "Open Problems": "Strictly proper scoring rules such as the Brier and Spherical scores improve calibration and downstream generation quality, but: 1) they converge noticeably slower than the standard logarithmic (cross-entropy) loss when training from scratch; 2) practitioners must choose between fast learning (log-loss) and better calibration/generation (Brier/Spherical). A minimal change that preserves the speed of log-loss while inheriting the calibration benefits of Brier/Spherical is still missing.",
    "Methods": "Dynamic Proper-Score Mixing (DPSM)\n1. At every token we compute both the standard cross-entropy (CE) and the Brier loss.\n2. A single scalar weight α_t\\in[0,1] interpolates between them:\n   L_t = (1−α_t)·CE_t + α_t·Brier_t.\n3. α_t is scheduled to rise smoothly from 0 to 1 during training, e.g.\n   α_t = min(1, step / warmup_steps)  (linear)  or  α_t = 0.5·(1−cos(π·step/warmup_steps))  (cosine).\n   • Early training (α≈0): optimisation follows CE → rapid likelihood fitting.\n   • Late training (α≈1): optimisation follows Brier → improved calibration & generation quality.\n4. No extra hyper-parameters except warmup_steps; keeps the objective strictly proper throughout (convex combination of two strictly proper scores).",
    "Experimental Setup": "Dataset: WikiText-2 (small-scale) and CNN/DailyMail summarisation (mid-scale).\nModels:  \n• GPT-2-small trained from scratch on WikiText-2.  \n• BART-base fine-tuned on CNN/DailyMail.\nBaselines: (i) CE only, (ii) Brier only, (iii) DPSM (ours).\nMetrics:  \n• Perplexity (PPL) for language modelling.  \n• Expected Calibration Error (ECE, 10 bins).  \n• ROUGE-1/2/L for summarisation.\nTraining details: identical optimiser & learning-rate schedule for all runs; DPSM uses warmup_steps = 10% of total steps.",
    "Experimental Code": "import torch, torch.nn.functional as F\nclass DPSMLoss(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size:int, warmup_steps:int=10000, schedule:str='linear'):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n        self.warmup = warmup_steps\n        self.schedule = schedule\n        self.register_buffer('global_step', torch.tensor(0.))\n    def _alpha(self):\n        s = self.global_step\n        if self.schedule=='linear':\n            return torch.clamp(s / self.warmup, 0., 1.)\n        # cosine schedule\n        x = torch.clamp(s / self.warmup, 0., 1.)\n        return 0.5 * (1 - torch.cos(torch.pi * x))\n    def forward(self, logits, targets):\n        self.global_step += 1\n        log_p = F.log_softmax(logits, -1)              # [B,T,V]\n        p = log_p.exp()\n        ce = F.nll_loss(log_p.view(-1,log_p.size(-1)), targets.view(-1), reduction='none')\n        one_hot = F.one_hot(targets, self.vocab_size).type_as(p)\n        brier = ((p - one_hot)**2).sum(-1).view_as(ce)\n        alpha = self._alpha()\n        loss = (1-alpha)*ce + alpha*brier\n        return loss.mean()",
    "Expected Result": "1. WikiText-2: DPSM matches CE perplexity after full training (±0.2 PPL) while reducing ECE by ~35% and converging 1.8× faster than pure Brier.\n2. CNN/DailyMail: DPSM improves ROUGE-L by ≈0.7 points over CE and ≈0.3 over Brier, with noticeably better calibration (-30% ECE).\n3. Training curves show CE-like rapid loss drop in early epochs and Brier-like calibration gains in later epochs.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A single-line interpolation between cross-entropy and Brier scores delivers the best of both worlds: fast convergence and superior calibration/generation quality. Because it is strictly proper, easy to implement, and hyper-parameter-light (one warm-up length), DPSM can be dropped into any existing LLM training pipeline with minimal code change yet yields measurable accuracy and reliability gains."

**Overall Experimental Strategy:** Unified Experimental Strategy for Validating Dynamic Proper-Score Mixing (DPSM)

1. Core Hypotheses to Validate
   H1 – Performance: DPSM attains the same or better task performance (likelihood or downstream scores) as pure cross-entropy (CE).
   H2 – Calibration: DPSM matches or surpasses the calibration of pure Brier/Spherical scores.
   H3 – Convergence Speed: DPSM converges almost as fast as CE and markedly faster than Brier/Spherical.
   H4 – Efficiency: DPSM adds ≤2 % computational overhead (memory, GPU-hours) relative to CE.
   H5 – Robustness & Generalization: DPSM’s benefits hold across model sizes, tasks, datasets, optimisation settings, and random seeds.

2. Validation Dimensions & Metrics
   a. Quantitative Task Quality
      • Language modelling: Perplexity (PPL), NLL
      • Seq-to-seq (summarisation, translation, code): ROUGE/BLEU/CodeBLEU
   b. Calibration
      • ECE (10 & 100 bins), Brier score, reliability diagrams
   c. Learning Dynamics & Efficiency
      • Convergence curves (steps vs PPL/ECE) and wall-clock time
      • GPU utilisation, peak memory, throughput (tokens/s)
   d. Robustness & Generalization
      • Out-of-domain (OOD) datasets, different seeds (≥3), noisy labels (synthetic corruption)
   e. Qualitative Analysis
      • Human preference ratings on generated text, diversity (Distinct-n)

3. Comparison Grid (applied to every experiment)
   Baselines:
   • CE only (fast learning)
   • Brier only (strong calibration)
   • CE + temperature scaling post-hoc (industry standard fix)
   • Label smoothing & focal loss (alternative in-loss fixes)
   Ablations:
   • DPSM with fixed α (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
   • DPSM with linear vs cosine schedule
   • Warm-up length sweep (5 %, 10 %, 20 %)

4. Experimental Angles
   Angle 1 – From-scratch Training (small/medium models): proves H1–H4 under full optimisation control.
   Angle 2 – Fine-tuning (larger pretrained checkpoints): tests plug-and-play practicality and H5.
   Angle 3 – Stress Tests: OOD data, corrupted labels, low-resource splits; probes robustness.
   Angle 4 – Scaling: repeat Angle 1 at three model scales (≈125 M, 355 M, 1.3 B params) to expose trends.
   Angle 5 – Efficiency Audit: profile a fixed batch of 2 k tokens on the A100 for every loss variant.

5. Success Criteria (must satisfy simultaneously)
   • Task quality: ≤0.3 PPL gap or ≥+0.3 ROUGE/BLEU relative to CE; never worse than both CE & Brier.
   • Calibration: ≥25 % ECE reduction vs CE and within 5 % of Brier.
   • Convergence: reach 95 % of final CE performance in ≤110 % of CE wall-clock time and in ≤60 % of Brier time.
   • Efficiency: memory overhead ≤500 MB; throughput drop ≤2 %.
   • Robustness: advantages hold (same inequality signs) across ≥75 % of robustness settings and seeds.

6. Experimental Logistics
   • Hardware: single or multi-A100 nodes leveraging 80 GB VRAM and 2 TB RAM; mixed-precision (bfloat16) everywhere.
   • Repetition: 3 seeds per configuration; report mean±stdev; statistical tests (paired t-test p<0.05).
   • Tracking: use Weights & Biases for unified logging; standardised training scripts with a config flag selecting the loss.
   • Budget: cap total GPU time at 10 % above the equivalent CE-only research campaign by prioritising mid-scale runs and pruning under-performing ablations early.

7. Reporting Template (uniform across papers/sections)
   1. Learning curves (PPL & ECE) with wall-clock on x-axis
   2. Final metrics table (means, stdev, significance stars)
   3. Efficiency table (time/step, memory, tokens/s)
   4. Reliability diagrams (CE vs DPSM)
   5. Qualitative snippet comparison & human study results

This unified, multi-angle strategy ensures that every experiment—regardless of dataset, model, or training regime—jointly interrogates DPSM’s main claims: fast learning like CE, calibration like Brier, negligible overhead, and broad robustness.

## Current Experiment to Evaluate

**Experiment ID:** exp-1-language-modelling-scaling

**Experiment Description:** Objective / hypothesis: Validate H1–H4 on from-scratch language-model training across three model scales. Show that DPSM preserves CE-level perplexity, approaches Brier-level calibration, converges almost as fast as CE, and adds <2 % overhead.

Models: GPT-2-small (125 M), GPT-2-medium (355 M), GPT-2-large (774 M).

Datasets: WikiText-103 (main), WikiText-2 (sanity check). Both are pre-tokenised with the standard GPT-2 BPE (50 502 tokens).

Pre-processing:  
• Strip empty lines, normalise Unicode, lowercase only for WikiText-103-LM-bench variant.  
• Pack into 1024-token sequences with EOS delimiter; drop remainder <32 tokens.  
• Mixed-precision (bfloat16) token/grad storage.

Data splitting: Official WikiText-103 train/valid/test. No further shuffling. Token-based deterministic split.

Repetitions: 3 random seeds per variation. Report mean±std. Selection criterion: best validation perplexity checkpoint (early stopping patience = 5 epochs).

Evaluation metrics:  
Primary – Perplexity (PPL, ↓).  
Secondary – NLL, ECE (10 & 100 bins), Brier score, Spherical score, expected recursion depth (for analysis).  
Efficiency – tokens/s, wall-clock to 95 % final PPL, peak GPU memory, FLOPs/step.

Comparisons:  
• ce-baseline – standard cross-entropy.  
• brier-baseline – pure Brier.  
• dpsm-linear – α schedule linear warm-up 10 % steps.  
• dpsm-cosine – cosine warm-up 10 %.  
• dpsm-fixed-alpha0.5 – α constant 0.5 from step 0 (ablation).

Hyper-parameter sensitivity: sweep warmup_steps ∈ {5 %, 10 %, 20 %} on GPT-2-small using Population Based Training; record PPL/ECE; include best curve in Appendix.

Robustness assessments:  
• Label noise: randomly flip 10 % of tokens within each batch for 5 % of training steps.  
• OOD generalisation: evaluate trained checkpoints on BooksCorpus-held-out split.  
• Seed variance: report variance inflation factor across 3 seeds.  
All robustness metrics reported as deltas vs clean CE baseline.

Efficiency analysis: Use PyTorch profiler + NVIDIA Nsight to log CUDA kernel time, memory, FLOPs for 2 000-token batch. Summarise mean overhead per step.

Example code:
```
# loss_selector.py
if args.loss == 'ce':
    criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
elif args.loss == 'brier':
    criterion = BrierLoss(vocab)
elif args.loss.startswith('dpsm'):
    schedule = 'linear' if 'linear' in args.loss else 'cosine'
    fixed = 0.5 if 'fixed' in args.loss else None
    criterion = DPSMLoss(vocab, warmup_steps=int(0.1*total_steps),
                         schedule=schedule, fixed_alpha=fixed)
```
Expected outcome: dpsm-linear and dpsm-cosine match CE PPL within ±0.3 while cutting ECE by ≥30 %; converge in ≤1.1× CE wall-clock and ≤0.6× Brier time; overhead <1.5 % memory / <2 % throughput drop.
